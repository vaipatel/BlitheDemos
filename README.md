# Blithe OpenGL Demos
a place for me to tinker with OpenGL things. And even non-OpenGL things. An atelier if you will.

## Why Blithe
Cuz it can be "Blit The.." anything (OpenGL Demos!), or "Blit.H.Engine", or something. And blit's a render-y word..

Cuz I just want to blithely blit the blithering bits.
